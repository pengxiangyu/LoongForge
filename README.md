## 📖 About

> 🐉 **The Baige "Loong" Family:** LoongForge (alongside [LoongFlow](https://github.com/baidu-baige/LoongFlow)) is part of the Loong open-source series from Baidu's Baige AI infrastructure platform, named after the traditional Chinese loong boat.

**LoongForge** is a training framework for large-scale transformer models across diverse modalities and architectures. It supports key stages of the training pipeline, including pre-training, continued pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Built upon Megatron-LM with significant enhancements, LoongForge delivers an efficient, easy-to-use, and highly extensible solution for model training.

* **🚀 Comprehensive Model Coverage**: Natively supports mainstream model architectures including LLMs (Large Language Models), VLMs (Vision-Language), VLAs (Vision-Language-Action), and Diffusion Models. Its flexible composition abstraction makes adding new multi-modal variants effortless.
* **⚡ Performance-Driven Optimization**: Provides advanced optimizations in parallelism and memory management, significantly reducing training costs and accelerating model development.
* **🧪 Heterogeneous Hardware Support**: Provides native, high-performance support for both NVIDIA GPUs and Kunlun XPUs, ensuring seamless migration and stable training at scale across diverse hardware clusters.

## 🔥 Latest News
- **[2026/04]** 🎉 Initial release of the LoongForge framework!

## ✨ Key Features

* **Flexible Composition**: A configuration-driven approach to assemble VLMs using interchangeable ViT and LLM components.
* **Heterogeneous Parallelism**: Enables assigning independent configurations—such as Tensor/Data Parallel sizes and recomputation layers—to different model components (e.g., Vision Encoder vs. LLM) for optimal throughput and memory efficiency.
* **Decoupled Encoder-Decoder Training**: Separates vision encoder and LLM into independent tasks, eliminating encoder-induced pipeline bubbles and preventing ViT computation from blocking LLM throughput.
* **DP Load Balancing**: Leverages a load-aware data redistribution algorithm to optimize data parallel imbalances caused by data packing, improving multi-node scaling efficiency.
* **MoE A2A Optimization**: Overlaps All2All communication, activation offloading, and computation to optimize memory usage and communication in large-scale MoE models, achieving lower memory footprint than upstream Megatron-LM.
* **Custom Fused Operators**: High-performance fused operators like FusedDSA, which integrates flashmla and indexer forward operators with custom backward operators (essential for training) to accelerate DSA model training. Currently the TileLang-based operators are open-sourced.
* **Adaptive FP8 precision**: End-to-end FP8 training support for both LLMs and VLMs, further enhanced with adaptive FP8 that automatically determines whether to enable FP8 per operator based on GEMM shape and computational efficiency to maximize training performance.
* **Flexible Checkpoint Conversion**: Supports both **offline bidirectional Megatron ↔ HuggingFace weight conversion** and **native online HuggingFace checkpoint load/save**, eliminating format barriers throughout the training workflow.
* **Versatile Pipeline & Tools**: Out-of-the-box support for Pretrain, MidTrain, SFT, and LoRA, with built-in tools for dataset processing such as format conversion and packing.
* **Heterogeneous Hardware**: Supports training on both NVIDIA GPUs and Kunlun XPUs via a minimally intrusive plugin design.

* **Enhanced long-sequence training** with optimization techniques such as ChunkPipe scheduling and Context Parallelism (CP) to improve throughput and scalability.
* **Real-world application of MTP scaling** to improve speculative decoding acceptance rates.
